  <!--
<p> For many years I have been thinking about how it can be that there are certain types of personalities.
  During my path, I came across many potential explanations:
<ul>
  <li>Astrology</li>
  <li>Genetics</li>
  <li>Experiences</li>
</ul>
  At home we had a book about astrology.
  Somehow the time of your birth should determine your character traits.
  In my experience, there is a lot of confirmation bias going on with this theory, and it's accuracy seems to be a matter of interpretation.
</p>
<p>
  I was recommended to read the book "The selfish gene".
  I have read in its reviews that people saw their world in shards after reading the book, because understanding that the only immortal entity in this world is a gene,
  and that the only purpose of the gene is to replicate, seems nihilistic to some people and takes away their life's purpose.
  Me personally, I enjoyed this book greatly, and it makes a whole lot of sense that this is how we evolved.
  After finishing the book, I still had this one lingering question unanswered:
  If two people have the same genes, and they are born at the same time (twins), how can it be that they end up with two different personalities?
  The theory of astrology would predict that they have the same personality, but looking at the evidence, that just can’t be.
  The gene theory does not have an answer to this question either.
</p>
<p>
  I came across the book "How emotions are made".
  It is a book that explores the science of emotions and how they are generated by the brain.
  Barrett argues that emotions are not hardwired into our brain and that they are constructed by our brain based on our experiences and cultural upbringing.
  The book presents a new model of emotions that challenges traditional views of emotions and offers a more nuanced understanding of how emotions are experienced and expressed.
  And suddenly, just as the gene theory had made so much sense in explaining how the homo sapiens evolved, this theory made all the loose bits and pieced I had flying around in my head come together.
</p>
<img src="images/Skizze.png" alt="Path to enlightenment">

<p>
  I believe that personalities are "stable strategies", just like surviving genes are the ones that proved to be stable in their environment.

  If we believe that our emotions are made, that our reality is made by ourselves, piece by piece and every day a bit, such that it never seems like we are constructing it, but once we are older have gone through so many patterns that there seems to be no way back.
  If we believe that, then combining the emotions theory with the gene theory answers all our questions.

  The brain is bayesian.
  I have heard this statement a lot and always thought I knew roughly what is meant by that. Hear my complete theory of what is meant by the statement: ‘The brain is bayesian’:

  Genes provide you with the starting conditions. But once you are alive, they can’t really determine your daily actions. Your genes are your prior information about the world. The likelihood function is then learned by yourself, day after day, fine-tuned and adjusted.

  That is why personalities are continuous, and there are infinitely many combinations that result in personalities. But we are able to categorise them, because only a couple seem to be ‘stable personalities’.
  Partially this might be because life gives you constraints on what you can do and what the society around you wants you to do, so our brains converge to similar personalities.

  With stable I don’t mean that it is a good behavioural pattern. It can be a very poor one, that makes people around you unhappy, that makes yourself unhappy. But it is the one that your brain came up with given all your past experiences and your starting condition (your genes). You can’t change your genes, but you can change how your experiences affect you, which information you extract. Which information you pay attention to. Which details you focus on and what you remember.

  Life is a dynamical system.
  This might also be why twins and sibling can end up having quite different personalities: Although they are given the same starting conditions, because one of them converges towards one trait, this trait might become unavailable for the other, it nudges him towards a different stable equilibrium.

  That is why certain behavioural patterns become almost impossible to unlearn once you get old. Because you have lived them so many times and your brain has evaluated to be stable, you always catch yourself only at the end of your performed action, with apparently no chance to interfere in your behavioural pattern.
  Give example for myself: Me for example I tend to show an avoidance behaviroal pattern when I am in emotional situations. My stable behavioural pattern is to distance myself from the situation. Even though I know this and I try to counteract it, I find myself in the same situations with the same thoughts and the same behaviour. Only very slowly and with a lot of introspection am I able to ‘unlearn’ this stable strategy and to offer a new one to my brain. And this is only after my 25 years of age.

  This book shattered what I though is true about the world, by giving me the tools to answer some lingering questions I have about our existence.
  It gives me hope that we are all the creators of our own world, without being aware, but can thus change our perception as much as we like.
</p>
<p>I have recently read the book “Siddhartha” by Herman Hesse, and I feel like what spirituality does for Siddhartha, Neuroscience does for me.

  Both books deal with the nature of the human experience and how our thoughts and emotions shape our understanding of the world. In "Siddhartha," the main character's journey is driven by his desire to understand the nature of reality and to find inner peace. Similarly, "How Emotions Are Made" is concerned with understanding the nature of emotions and how they shape our understanding of the world.

  The goal to achieve inner peace then seems to me to be achievable by first understanding the likelihood function you learned. If iyour learned behaviours end up making you unhappy, you need to realise them and learn different patterns. Once these new patterns are established, and they make you happy, you have successfully made one step towards enlightenment.

  One theme I have noticed in siddartha is that people seem to want to escape from reality.
  I understand enlightenment of the achievement of being “Im Reinen mit sich selbst”, to have converged towards a stable likelihood function that you are content with and that because of this, you don’t feel the need to escape reality anymore.
  As the author of “Dopamine nation” puts it:
  “The relentless pursuit of pleasure (and avoidance of pain) leads to pain.
  “Instead of running away from the world, we can find escape by immersing ourselves in it”.

  But this is not the whole story. As I see it:[Being addicted, trying to avoid reality as much as possible ————
  Resetting your pleasure/ pain balance. This is only halfway through. Now we have a clear mind and can reflect on our behaviour ——we are on our path to enlightenment: we have to figure out which default behaviour we want to change, what we want to do instead, and work really really hard to reset XXX years of being at the same local minima. Once we achieve that, and we are completely happy with who we are and how we are, independent of anyone else and prepared for any situation life throws at us, I would call this enlightenment.]

  I realise that the path is individual for everyone, but the tools can be provided. Its individual because everyone was given a different starting condition and learned a different set of stable behaviour, but being aware that you are the creator of your world is the first step to enlightenment.

  I found the same concept in Nietzsches “ubermensch”.

  Nietzsche: Human all too human. We have all these default behaviour patterns and we are so caught up in them that it seems impossible to break out.

  The path is individual, but the goal seems always the same. To break out of your patterns, to be able to adjust them however you want.

  What you need is a clear goal of what you want to change and what you want to do instead. Only knowing that you don’t want to act in a certain way anymore is not enough. You need to provide an alternative to your brain, because the brain needs to do something. Even staying completely calm and unaffected, and finding plesaure in the simple things, as it is practiced by stoicism, is an alternative that you need to provide to your brain.
