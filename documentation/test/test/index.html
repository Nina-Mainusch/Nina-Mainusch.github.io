If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or assert legal claims, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of erasure. If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) DSGVO, a balancing of your and our interests must be carried out.

<h4 id="cookies">Cookies</h4>
<p>Our website uses so-called &ldquo;cookies&rdquo;. Cookies are small text files and do not cause any damage to your terminal device. They are stored either temporarily for the duration of a session (session cookies) or permanently (permanent cookies) on your end device. Session cookies are automatically deleted at the end of your visit. Permanent cookies remain stored on your end device until you delete them yourself or until they are automatically deleted by your web browser. In some cases, cookies from third-party companies may also be stored on your terminal device when you enter our site (third-party cookies). These enable us or you to use certain services of the third-party company (e.g. cookies for processing payment services). Cookies have various functions. Many cookies are technically necessary, as certain website functions would not work without them (e.g. the shopping cart function or the display of videos). Other cookies are used to evaluate user behaviour or display advertising. Cookies that are necessary to carry out the electronic communication process (necessary cookies) or to provide certain functions desired by you (functional cookies, e.g. for the shopping cart function) or to optimise the website (e.g. cookies to measure the web audience) are stored on the basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO, unless another legal basis is specified. The website operator has a legitimate interest in storing cookies for the technically error-free and optimised provision of its services. If consent to the storage of cookies has been requested, the storage of the cookies in question is based exclusively on this consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO); consent can be revoked at any time. You can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of cookies and only allow cookies in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or in general and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. If you deactivate cookies, the functionality of this website may be limited. If cookies are used by third-party companies or for analysis purposes, we will inform you about this separately within the framework of this data protection declaration and, if necessary, request your consent.</p>

<h4 id="storage-of-the-ip-address">Storage of the IP address</h4>
<p>Our comment function stores the IP addresses of users who post comments. Since we do not check comments on this website before they are activated, we need this data in order to be able to take action against the author in the event of legal violations such as insults or propaganda.</p>
<h4 id="storage-period-of-comments">Storage period of comments</h4>
<p>The comments and the associated data (e.g. IP address) are stored and remain on this website until the commented content has been completely deleted or the comments have to be deleted for legal reasons (e.g. insulting comments). Legal basis The comments are stored on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO). You can revoke your consent at any time. All you need to do is send us an informal e-mail.
